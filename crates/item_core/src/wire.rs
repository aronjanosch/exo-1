//! The item messages as bytes (C2). They travel over a reliable, ordered channel
//! (`net_core::reliable`), so none is lost, doubled or overtaken; the encoding is compact JSON
//! (serde), which is easy to read in a capture and plenty for the few messages items send.
//! Loose items' poses while they move are not here: they are datagrams (`net_core::loose`).
